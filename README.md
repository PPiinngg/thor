WIP plugin framework

Debugging a plugin requires a host for it to run in, and the included setup for VSCode uses [clap-validator](https://github.com/free-audio/clap-validator?tab=readme-ov-file) which you can get the most recent build of [here](https://nightly.link/free-audio/clap-validator/workflows/build/master). Put the executable in the root directory of this repo and it should work!

The included scripts are written in [nushell](https://www.nushell.sh), but they're not doing a whole lot so it should be trivial to adapt them to whatever you use.
